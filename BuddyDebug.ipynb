      "Let's break down this super important first line of code. It's like learning to say \"hello\" in a new language, but this time, the language is Python!\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Your Python Code: `print(\"hello\")`\n",
      "\n",
      "This single line of code is telling your computer to do something very specific. Let's look at each part:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **`print`**:\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** This is a special keyword in Python, called a **function**.\n",
      "    *   **What it does:** Think of `print()` as your way to **talk** to the computer. It's like saying, \"Hey computer, display this for me!\" Whatever you put inside its parentheses `()` will be shown on your screen (or \"console\").\n",
      "    *   **Analogy:** Imagine you have a little robot helper. `print` is like giving the robot a command: \"Robot, *display* this message!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **`(` and `)`**:\n",
      "    *   **What they are:** These are parentheses.\n",
      "    *   **What they do:** They are super important! They tell Python that `print` is a function, and whatever you want to print goes *inside* them. It's like putting your message *into* the messenger's hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **`\"hello\"`**:\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** This is the actual *message* you want to display. In programming, a collection of letters, words, or sentences like \"hello\" is called a **string**.\n",
      "    *   **What the `\"\"` do:** The double quotes `\"\"` around \"hello\" are how you tell Python: \"Hey, this is a piece of text! Don't treat it like a command or a number; just treat it as characters I want to display exactly as they are.\"\n",
      "    *   **Analogy:** The quotes are like putting your message \"hello\" into an envelope. The computer knows everything inside the envelope is just the message to deliver, not instructions on *how* to deliver it.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### What Happens When You Run It:\n",
      "\n",
      "When you run this code, Python reads your instruction: \"Computer, please use the `print` function to display the string 'hello'!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Python then follows your command perfectly!\n",

      "---\n",

      "```\n",
      "hello\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why this:** Python successfully took the `string` \"hello\" that you provided inside the `print()` function and displayed it directly on your screen.\n",
      "*   **Notice:** The quotes `\"\"` are *gone* in the output! That's because the quotes were just there to tell Python \"this is a piece of text\"; they aren't part of the text itself that you wanted to display.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**In simple terms:** You successfully told your computer to say \"hello\" to you!\n",

      "    *   **`float()`**: Whatever you typed (which Python sees as text), `float()` tries to turn it into a *decimal number*. So, if you type `5`, `float()` makes it `5.0`. If you type `3.14`, it stays `3.14`. This is important because you want to do math with these numbers.\n",
      "    *   **`n1=`**: This part means, \"Take the decimal number you just got and put it into a 'box' that I'm calling `n1`.\" `n1` is a **variable**, which is just a fancy name for a storage container for a value.\n",

      "1.  **`print()`**\n",
      "    *   **Think of it like:** Your computer's way of *talking back* to you!\n",
      "    *   **What it does:** The `print()` function (a \"function\" is like a mini-program that does a specific task) tells Python to display whatever you put inside its parentheses `()` on the screen. It's how your program shows you messages, results, or any information.\n",

The quotes tell Python, \"Hey, this is text! Don't try to interpret it as a command or a number; just treat it as characters.\"\n",

      "### Putting It All Together:\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when you write `print('hello')`:\n",

      "### Why the Result Is `hello`:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   When you run this code, Python executes the `print()` function.\n",
      "*   The `print()` function looks inside its parentheses, sees `'hello'`, and knows it needs to show that text.\n",
      "*   It then displays the *content* of the string (`hello`) in your output area (which is often called the \"console\" or \"terminal\").\n",
      "*   Notice the quotes (`'`) are **gone** in the output. That's because the `print()` function's job is to show you the actual message, not the quotes that were just there to mark it as text for Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Your Big Takeaway:\n",
      "\n",
      "The `print()` function is your go-to tool for making your Python programs communicate with you or anyone using them. It's how you'll see what your code is doing!\n",

      "(\"😡 Error: NameError: name 'hello' is not defined\", 'Ah, great question! This is one of the *most common* errors beginners run into, and it teaches us something super important about how Python works. Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll break it down!\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Your Code: `print(hello)`\\n\\nYou\\'re trying to make your computer say \"hello\" on the screen. Good idea! The `print()` function is exactly what you need for that.\\n\\n### The Result/Error: `😡 Error: NameError: name \\'hello\\' is not defined`\\n\\nThis scary-looking message is Python telling you, \"Hey, I don\\'t know what \\'hello\\' means!\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Let\\'s break it down in simple terms:\\n\\n1.  **The `print()` Function:**\\n    *   Imagine `print()` like a talking robot 🤖. Its job is to take whatever you give it and speak it out loud (display it on your screen).\\n\\n2.  **What Python Thinks `hello` Is:**\\n    *   When you write `print(hello)` *without quotation marks*, Python doesn\\'t see \"the word \\'hello\\'.\"\\n    *   Instead, Python thinks you\\'re giving it a **name** of something it should already know.\\n    *   **Think of it like this:**\\n        *   If you told your robot friend: \"Speak the word `apple`!\" it knows exactly what to say.\\n        *   But if you told your robot friend: \"Speak the contents of `my_fruit_box`!\" The robot would first need to *find* `my_fruit_box` and *then* see what\\'s inside. If it can\\'t find `my_fruit_box` anywhere, it would get confused!\\n\\n3.  **The `NameError`:**\\n    *   In your code, `hello` is like `my_fruit_box`. Python looked through its \"memory\" for something named `hello`.\\n    *   It expected `hello` to be a **variable** (like a labeled box holding information) or a **function** (a pre-defined set of instructions).\\n    *   Since you haven\\'t told Python what `hello` *is* (you didn\\'t create a variable named `hello` or define a function called `hello`), it raises a `NameError`. It\\'s essentially saying, \"I looked for something called \\'hello\\', but I couldn\\'t find any definition for it.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Super Important Fix: **Quotation Marks!**\\n\\nWhen you want Python to treat something as plain text (like words, sentences, or even just characters), you need to put it inside **quotation marks**. These are either single quotes (`\\'hello\\'`) or double quotes (`\"hello\"`).\\n\\n*   **Why?** Quotation marks tell Python: \"Don\\'t try to find a meaning for this; just treat it as a sequence of characters to be displayed exactly as they are.\"\\n*   This \"sequence of characters\" has a special name in programming: a **string**.\\n\\n### The Corrected Code:\\n\\n```python\\nprint(\"hello\")\\n```\\n\\n### What happens with the corrected code:\\n\\n1.  Python sees `print()`.\\n2.  It looks inside the parentheses and sees `\"hello\"`.\\n3.  Because of the quotation marks, Python understands: \"Aha! This is a **string** (just plain text). I should just display these characters as they are.\"\\n4.  And voilà! You\\'ll see `hello` printed on your screen.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Key Takeaway for Beginners:\\n\\nWhenever you want `print()` to display words or sentences exactly as you type them, *always* put them inside **quotation marks**! This tells Python it\\'s a piece of text (a \"string\"), not something it needs to look up or define.')\n",

      "(\"😡 Error: NameError: name 'n6' is not defined\", 'Hey there, aspiring Python whiz! 👋 Let\\'s break down this code step by step, just like we\\'re solving a puzzle together.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Understanding the Code\\n\\nThis code is all about doing some basic math operations using variables. Think of variables as little labeled boxes where you can store values.\\n\\n1.  **`n1=10`**\\n    *   Here, you\\'re creating a box labeled `n1` and putting the number `10` inside it.\\n\\n2.  **`n2=0`**\\n    *   Another box, `n2`, now holds the number `0`.\\n\\n3.  **`n3=20`**\\n    *   Box `n3` gets `20`.\\n\\n4.  **`n4=2`**\\n    *   Box `n4` gets `2`.\\n\\n5.  **`n5=5`**\\n    *   And finally, box `n5` holds `5`.\\n\\nAt this point, Python has all these numbers neatly stored away, ready to be used.\\n\\n6.  **`print(\"Adding first two numbers:\", n1+n6)`**\\n    *   The `print()` function is like asking Python to \"show me this!\" on the screen.\\n    *   First, it wants to show the text `\"Adding first two numbers:\"`.\\n    *   Then, it wants to calculate `n1 + n6`. Python looks at `n1` and finds `10`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Error! 😡 `NameError: name \\'n6\\' is not defined`\\n\\nThis is where Python throws its hands up and says, \"Whoa, I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about!\"\\n\\n*   **`NameError`**: This kind of error means you\\'ve used a *name* (like a variable name) that Python doesn\\'t recognize. It\\'s like calling out for \"Sparky\" when you\\'ve only ever introduced \"Buddy\" and \"Fido\" to Python.\\n*   **`name \\'n6\\' is not defined`**: Python is telling you specifically that it has no idea what `n6` is. You never created a box labeled `n6` and put a number in it (like `n6 = 30`).\\n\\n**Why did it happen?**\\nYou assigned values to `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, `n4`, and `n5`. But you never created `n6`. When Python reached the line `n1 + n6`, it found `n1` (which is `10`), but it couldn\\'t find `n6` anywhere in its memory.\\n\\n**What happens next?**\\nWhen Python encounters an error it doesn\\'t know how to fix, it stops running the code immediately. It doesn\\'t try to continue with the other `print` statements. That\\'s why you only see this one error, and not errors from the lines that follow.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What *Would* Happen If `n6` Was Defined? (Just for learning!)\\n\\nLet\\'s imagine you *did* define `n6`, say `n6 = 15`. Here\\'s what the rest of the code *would* have tried to do:\\n\\n*   **`print(\"Adding first two numbers:\", n1+n6)`**\\n    *   This line would have an error because `n6` isn\\'t defined.\\n    *   **If `n6` was defined (e.g., `n6 = 15`):** `10 + 15` would be `25`.\\n    *   **Output:** `Adding first two numbers: 25` (assuming you meant `n2` instead of `n6` like `n1 + n2`)\\n\\n*   **`print(\"Subtracting answer and third:\", (n1+n2) - n3)`**\\n    *   `(n1+n2)`: `10 + 0` equals `10`.\\n    *   `10 - n3`: `10 - 20` equals `-10`.\\n    *   **Output:** `Subtracting answer and third: -10`\\n\\n*   **`print(\"Multipling answer with fourth:\", n4 * ((n1+n2) - n3))`**\\n    *   We just calculated `((n1+n2) - n3)` as `-10`.\\n    *   `n4 * -10`: `2 * -10` equals `-20`.\\n    *   **Output:** `Multipling answer with fourth: -20`\\n\\n*   **`print(\"Deviding answer by fifth:\", (n4 * ((n1+n2) - n3)) / n5)`**\\n    *   We just calculated `(n4 * ((n1+n2) - n3))` as `-20`.\\n    *   `-20 / n5`: `-20 / 5` equals `-4.0`. (Python often gives you a decimal number, called a float, for division).\\n    *   **Output:** `Deviding answer by fifth: -4.0`\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Your Key Takeaways:\\n\\n1.  **Define Before You Use:** Always make sure you\\'ve assigned a value to a variable (like `variable_name = some_value`) *before* you try to use it in your code.\\n2.  **Read Error Messages:** Errors might seem scary, but they are your best friends! They tell you exactly what went wrong and often where to look for the problem. `NameError` is a very common one for beginners.\\n3.  **Python Stops on Errors:** When Python hits an error it can\\'t handle, it stops executing the rest of your code.\\n\\nKeep practicing! Every error is just a chance to learn something new. You\\'re doing great!')\n",
